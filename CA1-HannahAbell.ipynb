    "<h3>Theoretical Framework: Higher Education Affordability vs. Economic Strength Index (HEAEI)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Introduction and Justification of this Index</h5>\n",
    "<p> In 2025 there are many countries around the world, including Ireland which are facing a cost of living crisis. The cost of most things has risen, including higher education, which is making it harder for students worldwide to access. Tution fees have increased by approx 460% over the past 50 years, which has even outpaced inflation, according to (WGU, 2022). Whil some nations do offer free or a lower-cost education, other countries charge extreme and I think this will be interesting to compare.</p>\n",
    "<p> I want to look at this issue in a way that takes in realistic economic factors, aswell as information on universities in order to paint a more accurate picture to create this index.I will be comparing my higher education data to a country's economic strength (their GDP per capita). If I was to only consider the university data, I would not be able to properly analyse and visualise this data, and tell if a universities tution fees accuratly represents a countries econmic status.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Purpose of this Composite Index</h5>\n",
    "<p> The Higher Education Affordability vs. Economic Strength Index (HEAEI) will be aiming to rank countries based on the affordability of the higher education systems, relative to their economic capacity, which is defind as \"The amount an economy can produce using current capital at full tilt\" () . There will be multiple factors combined and compared in this Index, which will allow me to easily comapre various countries for the best outcome.\n",
    "<h5>The main goals of the HEAEI Index</h5>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> To find which countries offer the most affordable education based on their economic capacity</li>\n",
    "<li>Identify countries where the tution fees are much higher when compared to GDP per capita.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This index will be created using two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Global Tuition Fees & Education Trends 2024\n",
    "Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kathrinaroldan/global-tuition-fees-and-education-trends-2024\n",

    "<li>Public university tuition fees</li>\n",
    "<li>Private university tuition fees</li>\n",
    "<li>Number of universities</li>\n",
    "<li>Enrollment counts</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "2. World Bank GDP per Capita\n",
    "Link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\n",
